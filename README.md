# Scc_Logos
Just some logos I revised for software applications relating to Spartanburg Community College. 
Use as you'd like, it's their logo - i just made it better.


Logos included:

- Original SCC logo
- Black Logo
- Light Blue Logo
- Purple Logo (Flower underlay)
- Silver/Gray/White/Whatever you wanna call it
- Actually white Logo

All of these logos are transparent .png files
